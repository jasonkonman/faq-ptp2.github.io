# What is Type 2 Diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is an impairment in the way the body regulates and uses sugar (glucose) as a fuel. This long-term (chronic) condition results in too much sugar circulating in the bloodstream. Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems.

In type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two interrelated problems at work. Your pancreas does not produce enough insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — and cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar.

Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults, but the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people.

# Dietary guidelines for diabetics
Diabetes is a disease in which the body's ability to use glucose (sugar) is impaired. Diabetes is characterized by an increase in blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia). 

Unbalanced sugar levels can cause damage to various organs of the body over time. Healthy living habits, which include proper nutrition, maintaining a healthy body weight and regular exercise play an important role in balancing sugar levels.

- It is important to eat regularly and at regular times. 
- Eat 3 main meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), 2 snacks, and dinner, leaving a 3-hour gap between meals
Foods and sweet drinks that contain added sugar (such as sugar, corn syrup, fructose syrup, dextrose) soft drinks, cakes, cookies, various sweets, etc., are rich in calories but their nutritional value is low and therefore should be avoided. 
- It is advisable to eat from the carbohydrates (grains, legumes or fruits) at the various meals throughout the day, a little at each meal. 
It is advisable to eat foods that contain dietary fiber such as: whole grains (such as wheat, oats, buckwheat, whole rice, wholemeal / rye bread), legumes, (lentils, peas, beans, chickpeas, beans, soy), vegetables and fruits. 
- It is recommended to eat from all food groups (vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, proteins and fats). The more varied the menu, the greater the chance of getting the nutrients, vitamins and minerals the body needs. 
- It is recommended to avoid foods that contain trans fatty acids (hardened vegetable fat) such as: puff pastry, pastries and industrial snacks (sweet and salty). 
- Oily meat, skin, visible fat, internal organs, sausages and hot dogs, and dairy products that contain over 5% fat have a large amount of saturated fat and cholesterol, it is recommended to reduce their consumption. 
- It is advisable to drink at least 8 drinking glasses without sugar or honey. Artificial sweeteners can be used. 
- It is important to prevent hypoglycemia (a decrease in glucose levels of less than 70% mg), which is usually caused by a mismatch between medication and / or insulin and the amount of carbohydrates in a meal or exercise.
